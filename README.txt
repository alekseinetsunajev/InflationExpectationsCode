The related estimation code is provided in Matlab. Various subprograms are called from the main program in MAIN.m.
Requirements for running the code: Matlab, Optimization_Toolbox, Statistics_Toolbox.

To get the main results for the model considered in the paper, open the MAIN.m file in Matlab 
and let it run. It will take a while to complete. 
The results will be printed on the Matlab command window and then figures will appear.
